# CAProtect-Lite
This is a generalized version of a plugin developed for the Castaway network to protect against common tactics used by those attempting to build lag machines and generally cause meyhem.

In its current state, it will limit clumped-up stacks of minecarts to groups of 10. This behavior prevents players from stacking thousands of minecarts together to create lag using collision mechanics.
